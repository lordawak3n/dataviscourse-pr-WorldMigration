The README must also explain any non-obvious features of your interface.

We have created all the code in this project including the javascripts, stylesheet and documentations. The datasets are a result of the parsing operation that we performed on the raw data from the website using a C++ tool we created. The libraries that we used were as follows:-
For D3 - d3.v5.js
For D3 based tooltip - d3-tip.min.js
For topojson - topojson.js
For D3 based geometric utilities - d3-geo-projection.v2.js

To use this visualisation tool simply click on any country to know about its trend pattern over the years or click and drag the circle on the timeline slider to witness the immigration data changes over the years in the World map as an animation as well as on the trend and bar charts. The tooltip can be generated by hovering over a country or region of interest. This tooltip provides the immigration data for a specific country during a specific year.
